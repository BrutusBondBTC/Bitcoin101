# Bitcoin101

I'm working on a bitcoin course that teaches people how to use bitcoin begining with the early cypherpunk pioneers and teaching them how to use a.bitcoin wallet with satsie's new tool.

I also include tutorials on KYC free bitcoin and how to use a hardware wallet.  

The idea is to create something simmilar to Bitcoin Q and A's tutorials, but adding lectures and videos.

Please give me any suggestions you have.

Note: I am not interested in trading. This is more about using bitcoin, not drawing price divining charts.
